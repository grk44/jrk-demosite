                    <p>Bill brings over 50 years of experience to JR Kays Trucking. He began his career as a company driver, then moved on to become an owner/operator before moving inside to work in dispatch, safety, operations, and analysis. Then in 2009,
                        Bill bought the authority of JR Kays Trucking from an individual with one truck. Bill grew that operation with just a handful of owner operators. He has been key in the growth and development of what we have today - a combined
                        fleet of over 50 trucks. Though Bill has served in nearly every capacity in the trucking business, his real passion is in crunching numbers and analyzing profitability reports. Bill now enjoys a modified schedule, and spends his
                        down time rebuilding and driving muscle cars and hot rods, but he is still committed to his work in providing guidance and direction to the JR Kays Trucking family. Not a family dinner goes by that we don’t hash out the newest

                    <p>Grabbing the reigns of JR Kays Trucking from her father, Bill, in 2015 was natural since Lisa already had five years of grooming. Lisa joined the JR Kays Trucking family in 2010 with undergraduate degrees in both accounting and economics
                        and a master’s in education. In her previous 15+ years, she held various positions in the corporate and nonprofit sectors, with roles ranging from office management to executive accounting. Her aggressive motives in growth have
                        helped to take the company from a 25-30 truck operation to over 50 trucks today. Her goal is to slowly grow as far as the drivers will allow, she never wants to lose the family culture that attracts so many drivers who call JR
                        Kays home. She has a firm grasp of what it takes to increase profitability and utilizes all of the resources at her disposal to ensure that JR Kays Trucking operates at its highest efficiency both financially and safely. Lisa is
                        a fierce advocate in the trucking industry, and she works tirelessly to ensure that the safest and most qualified drivers are on the road and every driver has a voice. Her passion in the industry, especially for drivers and their
                        safety, is one of the things that puts her ahead of many other executives in trucking. She takes calls and advocates for drivers all over regardless of where they call home. Her appreciation for women in trucking and for our military
                        has shown in JR Kays’ recognition as a [year after year] top company for women to work by <strong><span style="color: #800000;">Women in Trucking</span></strong> and [year after year] recipient of the federal <strong><span style="color: #0521be;">Platinum Award for HIRE Vets</span></strong>                        program.</p>

                    Mike is a technical professional who joined JR Kays Trucking in 2012, bringing with him years of experience in industry safety, regulations, compliance, conflict resolution, and troubleshooting. Mike's leadership is invaluable in policy and correctional
                    strategies, and in compliance with state and federal regulations. His calm and positive demeanor allows for a positive and respected rapport with customers, drivers, and industry professionals including compliance officers. Mike's
                    advocacy at agencies and contributions to the community and the industry ensure that JR Kays and the transportation industry have a voice at local, state, and federal levels. He takes every opportunity to work with drivers and others
                    in the industry to not just educate and inform, but also to advocate on both sides for the respect a driver deserves and the safety we all expect. Mike works with <strong><span style="color: #1f6e00;">SmartWay</span></strong>                    and other agencies to keep our fleet certified in safety, efficiency, and sustainability – putting JR Kays in the lead in supporting high standards in effectiveness and fuel economy.

                    Rob has been a dedicated and valued member of the JR Kays Trucking core group of employees since his graduation from diesel mechanic school more than 25 years ago. Rob was promoted to VP of Operations as his strong business sense encompasses not only
                    the savvy equipment needs for our drivers that best complement our customer lane needs, but also the bottom line in keeping costs balanced without sacrificing driver comfort and safety. Rob continues to be responsible for supporting
                    our fleet maintenance department and has added driver management, safety, and compliance to his opportunities to build a great team and atmosphere among our drivers. Rob's fluidity and efficiency of bringing the equipment and driver
                    management together supports his discerning ability to prioritize driver and equipment safety and address new problems as the integration of drivers and equipment evolves. Rob's knowledge and technical proficiency keep safe and efficient
                    drivers and equipment on the road with minimal equipment down time and even less driver down time. Rob works with dispatch to ensure drivers have opportunities to be on lanes that work best for them, including safety, distance, and
                    home time. He also manages our safety program with the integration of Samsara and Infinit-I, always working to keep drivers rolling while maintaining the best compliance and safety scores possible.

                    to problem resolution and working with drivers to ensure their partnership in planning is set up in the most supportive way possible. Her years of experience in lanes, customers, shippers, receivers, and even equipment and everything
                    in between, has added to her natural talent to always put the driver first and develop the best workweek that suits the driver first and customer second. She is often using her perception and critical thinking skills to keep operations
                    smooth running and drivers have picked up on and come to rely on her ability to make quick, sound decisions. She truly listens to the drivers and supports them in their decisions to try new lanes, stay on certain lanes, or when they
                    really want to stretch, she gets them out west or down south for a change of scenery. Drivers can call all hours and Sue will take their call and help them through whatever they are dealing with, no matter what the time of day or what
                    the concern is. Drivers often comment that she is the "best dispatcher in the industry," and we could not agree more!

                    in a nearby town since her teenage years. She brought with her valuable experience and best business practices that transferred easily to JR Kays Trucking. Always sharing a smile and positive attitude, Annie's calm presence keeps everyone
                    focused on the most important aspects of business - our drivers and customers. She is able to multi-task easily, covering trucks, coordinating loading appointments, handling load issues, and overseeing the accounts receivable system
                    - all at once with little stress, and with extreme proficiency. The best part of her day is making a difference in day of the drivers and customers. She often comments how she doesn’t feel like she accomplishes anything if she doesn’t
                    put in a hard day of work, and that she does – she not only works hard, but she works to make every day better than the one before.

                    and driver interactions with their equipment needs. Having just filled in for a few months to support dispatch, David also still enjoys covering trucks and assisting in dispatch as needed.
